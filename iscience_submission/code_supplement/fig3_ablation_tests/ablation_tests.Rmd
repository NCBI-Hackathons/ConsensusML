This notebook describes the ablation tests performed from analyzing the TARGET AML dataset using the lasso and XGboost algorithms.

# Ablation Methods

To perform ablation test runs, we ran each penalized algorithm for 50 iterations, starting with the entire differentially expressed genes (DEGs) set. For each iteration after the first, we excluded ("ablated") selected features from all prior iterations before rerunning model optimization. 

# Ablation Results

We observed the following results after running ablation tests with lasso.

## Lasso Results

## XGBoost Results

We ran 70 iterations of ablation tests using XGBoost. Note that HOXA9 appears in the fourth iteration of XGBoost ablation.
