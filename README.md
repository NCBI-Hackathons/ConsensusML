Machine Learning to Detect Cancer Biomarkers from RNAseq Data

Workflow to apply machine learning methods for feature selection to determine sets of best discriminating gene bio-markers using RNAseq data from heterogeneous cancer populations.

This would be a workflow that is publicly available to bioinformaticians who use RNA-seq gene expression data to characterize tumors, and would assist in finding biomakers that are best able to identify specific subpopulations in a cancer cohort (eg TCGA AML, TARGET NBL, TARGET WT ).
